# ArbitrageCalculator
A calculator to generate ROI (Return on Investment) for hypothetical sports betting scenarios. You enter the odds of different bets along with the total investment you are willing to make to determine how much you should stake on each bet to guarantee a profit where possible. If the ROI is negative, there is no profit available.
